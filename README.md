# Viktor
a place to `add` your data references fast inside and get an `index` back
-> to remove it same at fast also later from your `Viktor` \o/
(nothing into your `memory allocation` needs to be `reorganized`.)

only some _optimizationTHING(^_^)_ ~~^^

  
## Installation
```
haxelib git viktor https://github.com/maitag/viktor.git
```

  
## Todo

- synopsis
- new types what not indicate values by `null` or `-1` if they gets deleted (on cost of iteration speed)
- a macro for Victor to choose between the types: `ViktorT<T>, ViktorInt` and the not-null new ones
- more backends what using Bytes instead of Vector
- unit tests, benchmarks, hxp, optimization
